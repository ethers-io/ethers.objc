/**
 *  Chain ID
 *
 *  As of EIP155, the chain ID can be used when signing requests to protect from
 *  replay attacks on other networks. This alters the internal structure of the
 *  payload that is hashed before signing the digest, so ChainIdAny is provided
 *  to continue using the legacy method of signing, but this also means the
 *  transaction is not safe against replays.
 *
 *  Note: ChainIdAny is NOT recommended
 *
 *  See: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/155
